# Bandit-Practice

## Level 5:

### Question:
Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

### Code :
```
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd ./inhere
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -size 1033c
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cd ./maybehere07/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere/maybehere07$ ls
-file1  -file2  -file3  spaces file1  spaces file2  spaces file3
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cd ..
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere02  maybehere04  maybehere06  maybehere08  maybehere10  maybehere12  maybehere14  maybehere16  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere03  maybehere05  maybehere07  maybehere09  maybehere11  maybehere13  maybehere15  maybehere17  maybehere19
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -readable -1033c
find: unknown predicate `-1033c'
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -size 1033c -readable
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

### Learnings:
- The -find command and how it operates
- We can use -size to specify the size of the file we are looking for.
- we can use -readable to specify if the file is human readable or not.
